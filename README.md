# SPI Based Embedded System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **Design and Development of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Based Embedded System**. The SPI protocol is a synchronous serial communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems to facilitate high-speed data transfer between a master device (microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (sensors, EEPROMs, etc.).

## Technical Specifications

### SPI Protocol Components
The Serial Peripheral Interface utilizes four main signal lines:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SCLK** | Serial Clock - synchronizes data transmission |
| **MOSI** | Master Out Slave In - data from master to slave |
| **MISO** | Master In Slave Out - data from slave to master |
| **SS/CS** | Slave Select/Chip Select - selects active slave device |
